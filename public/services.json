      "description": "Root canal is a treatment to repair and save a badly damaged or infected tooth instead of removing it. The term root canal comes from cleaning of the canals inside a tooth's root. Decades ago, root canal treatments often were painful. With dental advances and local anesthetics, most people have little if any pain during a root canal. In fact, it's probably more painful living with a decayed tooth. Root canal alternatives include extracting the damaged tooth, no further treatment, or replacing the tooth with a dental implant, bridge or removable partial denture.",

Bridges are usually made of porcelain or metal, a mixture of the 2, or zirconia. They are fixed in place and, for some people, are an alternative to dentures. A dental bridge is required if you have a missing tooth or teeth and have healthy teeth on either side of the gap left by the missing teeth.",

This condition affects both adults and children. In children, gaps may disappear once their permanent teeth grow in. Some gaps are small and barely noticeable, whereas other gaps are larger and a cosmetic issue for some people. If you donâ€™t like the way the gap looks, there are ways to close it or reduce its size.",
